                    <hi rend="bold">THE SULTAN'S SUCCESSOR The Constantinople correspondent of the
                        "Tribune” in a recent letter to our contemporary concerning the much
                        discussed question of the succession to the throne of Turkey writes as
                        follows:- For some weeks there have mysterious rumours of the possibility of
                        an attempt to change the succession to the Turkish throne. The most
                        persistent is that it is the desire of Abdul Hamid to appoint his third son,
                        Prince Burhan-ed-din, as his successor,and for this purpose to obtain the
                        consent of the Sheik-ul Islam and of the Ambassadors of the Great Powers. It
                        is even added that Abdul Hamid is thinking of abdicating in favour of this
                        prince. The rumoured step would be an exceedingly grave one. It is probable
                        that any attempt to make such a change without the consent of the ulema
                        class, of whom the Sheikul-Islam is the head, would fail, and might simply
                        plunge the country into revolution. It is further rumoured that the
                        Sheik-ul-Islam has een sounded, and that he has declared that such a change
                        could never be sanctioned. This, however, I do not believe. Rumour further
                        says that the German Emperor has been asked for his counsel, and that the
                        sudden return here, &amp; week lago, of the German Ambassador is in
                        connexion with this question. While fully admitting that we are dealing only
                        with rumours, these are so persistent and definite as to suggest that they
                        have a basis of truth, and the questions raised by them become interesting
                        and important.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="bold">The Moslem law of succession to a royal throne is based upon
                        long usage, and enacts that the heir is the eldest male in the Royal or
                        Imperial family. A simple illustration is furnished by the recent history of
                        Egypt, When Mehmet Ali became, by Imperial firman and the recognition of
                        Europe, Khedive of Egypt, the Sultan issued a firman in 1846 by which the
                        succession was to be regulated in the Moslem fashion--that is, the heir was
                        always to be the eldest male descended from Mehmet Ali. The rule was
                        strictly followed till the time of Ismail. On the death of Ismail the legal
                        heir to the Khedival throne should have been Prince Halim, the youngest son
                        of Mehmet Ali. But Ismail, in 1866, by means of very heavy payments, had
                        induced Abdul Aziz, the Sultan of Turkey (who was deposed, and "suicided" in
                        1876), to grant a new firman, by which the succession was changed from the
                        Moslem to the general European system of succession. When the
                        representatives of England and France decided in 1879 to get rid of Ismail,
                        they secretly, but unmistakably, gave him the opportunity to leave Egypt
                        quietly, in which case the firman which he had obtained would be re-1.
                        cognized, and his son allowed to reign in his stead. If he refused, Halim,
                        the "de jure'' heir by Moslem law, would be placed on the throne. He agreed
                        to go quietly. It was generally believed in this city that Abdul Aziz, in
                        granting the firman changing the Egyptian succession, had the intention to
                        change the succession to the Turkish throne. In such case Prince Yussuf
                        Izzedin would have been the heir apparent, The revolution of 1876 put an end
                        to any such design, and Murad, and then the present occupant, were girded
                        with the Sword of Osman in conformity with the well-established rule. At the
                        time, however, when the project of changing the Ottoman rule of succession
                        was in the air, it was well</hi>

                        They represent the conservative element of Islam; and unless some very
                        special circumstances should be brought forward, they would oppose a stout
                        resistance to any change of the kind. The present heir to the throne is
                        Reshad Effendi, the Sultan's brother. Both he and two elder brothers rank,
                        on the ground of age, before the third son of the present Sultan. The
                        supposed favourite of his Majesty for the secession is his third son, who is
                        known to the Ambassadors as a bright and intelligent young man of about
                        twenty years old. The question is mainly, though not exclusively, of course,
                        one for the subjects of his Majesty, and especially for his Moslem subjects.
                        If the change is attempted, it will probably give rise to considerable
                        trouble.</hi>

                        speak disparagingly of Reshad Effendi; but there will always be a party
                        strongly in his favour as representing the reign of Moslem law. There are
                        precedents for passing over the heir, but the change has always been
                        regarded as revolutionary.</hi>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="bold">Though, of course, the personality of the Sultan is for foreign
                        States a matter of great importance, the representatives of such States will
                        probably best consult the interests of their Governments, and certainly of
                        Turkey, by having nothing to do with any proposal to change the succession.
                        The fact that they or any of them favoured one candidate more than another
                        would do much to make him unpopular with the Moslem population. The matter
                        is primarily one for the Moslem people of Turkey, and for a foreign
                        Government to pronounce an opinion one way or another would have the
                        appearance of mixing in a Palace intrigue. If it be said that Turkey is more
                        or less under European tutelage, and that the unanimous consent of Europe to
                        a change of Moslem law would give it a sanction which would secure its
                        general acceptance, my reply would be that unanimity on this subject is
                        impossible, and to attempt to obtain it would occasion endless intrigue. It
                        may be admitted that if the general consent of Europe could be obtained it
                        might establish an important precedent. But if such consent has been applied
                        for, and if, as is rumoured, negotiations are going on, it is because
                        opposition is anticipated either by Turkey or by some foreign State. Even an
                        attempt by the Concert of Europe would be denounced by the Moslem population
                        as an interference by the giaours with their religious rights.</hi>

                    <hi rend="bold">There is much to be said for and much against the alleged
                        project. The generally expressed opinion is that certain Palace favourites,
                        for their own purposes, are in its favour, and this would not recommend it
                        to the Turkish population, and still less to Europeans. Indeed, in whatever
                        way the expe. diency of a change in the law of succession may be regarded,
                        its practical application will be dangerous. It will almost certainly lead
                        to disturbances, and it ought to be a question for Turkish statesmen whether
                        it is desirable to add to the many difficulties with which they have to deal
                        a possible war of succession. For foreign states the question is at once
                        tempting and dangerous. In the solution of the many questions in the Near
                        East with which our country is concerned, it is difficult to see what
                        advantage could be gained by entering upon it. Sir Edward Grey will probably
                        conclude that his wisest course is to reserve speech or action, and take up
                        the position that Great Britain will stand sloot, and neither approve or
                        disapprove any action of the kind which the Palace advisers may choose. to

                        <hi rend="bold">- "Al Minbar” states in its issue of yesterday that it has
                            received an official communication announcing that the journal will not
                            be admitted into the Soden. We can only express approval at the action
                            of the Sudan Government in view of the immoderation with which "Al
                            Minbar" discusses political question relating to the occupying Power.
                            The organs of the nationalist party have assumed the foolish course of
                            indulging in mere tirade against the advisers of the Khedive, and by
                            such bring upon themselves the possibility of a perfectly justifiable
                            suppression. We are rather inclined to hope that the prohibition of such
                            intemperate journals in the Body is an allegory of the application of a
                            censorship over the Press of Egypt. It is exceedingly regrettable that
                            there should be cause to seriously consider such an innovation, but a
                            certain section, which is not constituted by our vernacular
                            contemporaries alone, has become so seditions that we should feel
                            ourselves obliged to support the Government in any means which they
                            might deem necessary to check the violent and harmful declamations of
                            reasoning journalists. Let auch take a lesson from the suppression of
                            "Al Minbar" in the Sudan, and learn that their turbulence may preclude
                            them from the liberty which moderation would ensure and from the
                            consideration of serious men.</hi>

                                evidence to incriminate the onbashi and shawish, and, moreover, the

                                charge against the policemen, their evidence can not be considered

                            "Times" from the pen of Mr. Blunt, who therein expresses his "unlooked
                            for pleasure" at finding himself "one more attacked, after a silence of
                            some twenty years" by bis old adversary, Mr, Moberly Bell One can fully
                            understand Mr. Blant's delight at the advertisement which he has
                            received from a journal than which none other in the world stands
                            bigber, and were it not impossible to disregard the aspersions by which
                            he tries to vilify his mother-dation, the publicity which he has
                            received would be regrettable. Righteous indignation pickles in the
                            heart of every true Britisher at the calamities which are oast upon bis
                            nation by distorted facts emanating from one of the Empire's sons. Were
                            Mr. Blunt content to criticise his country in an equitable spirit, to
                            endeavour to obtain true and unbiased accounts of the happenings in
                            Egypt, and to moderate bis acrimony, one might read with interest and
                            seriously consider his Writing. But his obvious hatred for his country
                            makes one feel that it is impossible to wage with bim the war of pens
                            with the feeling that be is an adversary worthy of the steel.</hi>

                        <hi rend="bold">Mr. Blant's asseveration that the "Times" exaggerates his
                            anti-English attitude cannot be accepted, as, in the opinion of every
                            right minded person, a man who is guilty of such misrepresentation of
                            facts and hyperbolical statements to the detriment of his country, as
                            are contained in his writings, can only be pronounced an an'i
                            nationalist. We are well aware that his interest in the affairs and
                            people of Egypt is of the keenest, and on such a point we could heartily
                            agree with him, but in making it his obvious aim to sully the name of
                            Great Britaia in bor dealing, with a country which she has spatched from
                            the abyss of bankraptey and slavery and raised almost to the pinnacle of
                            prosperity be estranges that sympatby, which serious men could otherwise
                            hold for him. There might be some slight exons were Mr. Blant ignorant
                            of this country and its people, but he has passed a considerable portion
                            of twenty-five years in Egypt, during which time be bad seriously
                            studied the customs of the modern Egyptians, and he cannot have failed
                            to note the unwavering march of progre38 that the country has made under
                            our guidance. Indeed, one is driven to doubt the sincerity of the land
                            of Little-Englanders wbore cry of "British injustice in Egypt" is now so
                            pro prominent, especially in view of the fact that one of the most
                            conspicuous of these has a fall knowledge of the country from personal
                            experience.</hi>

                        <hi rend="bold">That Mr. Blant's latest publication will | receive credenos
                            in Bagland is hardly likely, for, happily, the majority of the home
                            Pross has dealt with the regrettable incident of Danish wai in that
                            equitable spirit which is still the predominant characteristic of the
                            Britisher, despite the attempts of a small declamatory party to persuade
                            the world of the contrary. There is the danger, however, that it may, in
                            conjunction with the impetuous orations of certain members of Parliament
                            and vehement articles of a few journalists lead some to doubt the wisdom
                            with which the representatives of Great Britain are directing the
                            Government of Bzyp", and, though these will speedily be convinced of the
                            injaatioe of such a conolasion if they care to study the question more
                            deeply, a certain amount of mischief may be caused. It is somewhat
                            remarkable that Mr. Blant should play a prominent part in the endeavour
                            of a few self styled nationalists to foment the native to the verge of
                            fanaticism, when he asserts such interest in their welfare, as he must
                            surely realise that any forcible demonstration would be to the serious
                            disadvantage of the people. The irrationality of Mr. Blant and his
                            fellow antinationalists, in addition to filling us with contempt, draw
                            upon us the contomely of foreign nations, who come to the not anpataral
                            conclusion that the abundance of Anglophobe Britishers/ is an indication
                            of the deterioration of our race. As the crow pounces with avidity upon
                            carrion, so sach men seize every opportunity to belittle their fellow
                            countrymen in the eyes of other nations. England, alas, is being
                            nauseat. ed by an unparalleled wave of anti-British hysteris, which
                            became epidemio at the commencement of the Boer war, and the sound of
                            raucous voices pouring undeserved reproach upon men who are
                            conscientiously and successfally striving to farther the interests of
                            coon tries which the first Power of the world has taken under her wing
                            has become sufficiently common to constitate a peril to the Empire. It
                            is deplorable that men of our own nationality endeavour to hide their
                            utter lack of patriotism under a sparious cloak of humanitarianism, and
                            hold ap to the world as martyrs semi-barbarians who have been guilty of
                            an extraordinarily bratal outrage. Such absolute anti-nationalism is
                            incomprehensible, and the attempt of our Little-Baglanders to drive
                            their mother country on to the rooks is worse than dastardly.</hi>

                            in existence in Egypt, it would be able to prevent any similar crisis
                            owing to its large reserve. But if such a bank were established, it
                            would in all probability find it advantageous to keep its reserve in
                            London just as the other bank, do, seeing that money can be obtained by
                            telegram in six days. To keep a large reserve permanently in Egypt would
                            involve loss of interest daring the summer to a considerable

                            Government and the Caisse de la Dette are somewhat to be blamed for the
                            existing string sy, as so much money gets looked upon its receipt in
                            payment of taxes Bat it would be as well to remind your readers that, in
                            virtue of the Anglo-French Agreement of 1904, the receipts of the land
                            tax are paid in to the Caisse de la Dette, which has no power to release
                            these sums, while the balance of the Government revenues are sufficient
                            at this season of the year to meet the outgoings in the shape of
                            ordinary expenditure. Consequently no blame for such a striogenoy can
                            fall on the Government. It is, on the contrary, the banks upon whom the
                            responsibility falls in failing to be prepared for such an extraordinary
                            contingency by making proper provision. On the other hand we do not
                            consider that the banker can be held to be so fall of foresight as to
                            anticipate such unexampled prices at the opening of the cotton season.

                        <hi rend="bold">Sir. – The ideal condition of existence in Cairo would be a
                            community of Anglo-Bgyptians officials, andistarbed by the presence of
                            any commercial people of their own race. The British commercial man is
                            doubt lou « vory well-meaning person in his way, but bii prosonce
                            introduces a certain jarring noto and I fally sympathise with the
                            attitude of French and German officialdom, who in the so-called colonies
                            of those nations do their boot to ensure a tranquil life by suppressing
                            the com mercial men of their own race by making their existence
                            intolerable. However, for good or ill, such is not the policy of the
                            British Government and in Cairo we should learn to tolerate them. We
                            need not arouse their irritation by patronising airs and should always
                            rather adopt a condescending attitude to this class of human beings, but
                            at the same time if they consider that their racial relationship to as
                            affords them a special right to oritioing, they should be taught to keep
                            to their place. The best way of treating these people is to adopt an
                            attitude of studied irony towards theta. Sach treatment would prevent
                            them from becoming familiar, as it appears to pozzle them.--I am, truly
