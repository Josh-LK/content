                            helped to ensure the success of the address from the Cape Colony which
                            was presented to Lord Milner last week An influential deputation came
                            all the way from South Africa to assure him that twenty-five thousand
                            signatories in the Cape Colony alone are true to the great principles
                            for which he worked unflinchingly in face of the most formidable
                            obstacles, those principles being "the gradual fusion of the white races
                            of South Africa into one nation, and the retention of that nation as a
                            permanent member of the British group of States." Sir Lewis Michell said
                            that he had never found him other than "calm and collected and
                            inflexibly resolute to see that by no act of his the British flag should
                            be trailed in the dust." Lord Milner no longer holds any official
                            position ; his influence consists solely of the weight which attaches to
                            the opinions expressed in his speeches, and their general tenor conveys

                            the Government announced the terms on which they had decided I to grant

                        <hi rend="bold">Some people, it is well known, take pleasure in prophesying
                            evil; the raven's croak is their natural voice. It is not so, however,
                            with Lord Milner. If he had been a pessimist he could never have lived
                            through the arduous years from 1898 to 1904, and kept the firm faith
                            which he always professed in the future of South Africa. It would be
                            much more gratifying to him to believe that things were going well, as,
                            indeed, they were, until this Government came into power and started
                            their policy of meddling and muddling in South African affairs-in Natal
                            as in the Transvaal. Lord Milner devoted most of his speech yesterday
                            not to any specific act of the Government, such as the new Constitution,
                            nor yet to any of the great problems of South Africa in which British
                            interests have been jeopardised by those who now have the deciding voice
                            at home. He holds that the most pressing danger of the moment in South
                            Africa is disunion among the British Colonists, who seem ready on the
                            very eve of the first electoral trial of strength to split into groups
                            over merely personal differences, in face of a united Dutch party, which
                            preaches incessantly a Dutch South Africa. But the danger of the moment
                            at home is even greater, for it is the growth of what Lord Milner called
                            the spirit of antinationalism. This is a subject to which we have often
                            referred in these columns, since it is constantly breaking out in new
                            forms and varieties, the only constant symptom being the inveterate
                            belief that in any political quarrel one's own countrymen must be in the
                            wrong.</hi>

                        <hi rend="bold">An Englishman has only to cross the seas, and in the view of
                            those who suffer from this strange "disease of opinion” he changes his
                            nature as well as his sky. With the mind of the pro-Boer during the war
                            everyone was painfully familiar. In some the malady reached the stage of
                            delirium, and drove them to say that, unless the Boer cause triumphed,
                            they would have to reconsider their belief in Providence. Perhaps the
                            policy of the present Government may spare them such reconsideration, if
                            they have not already performed that mental exercise, for to give away
                            what we have won by hard fighting and vast sacrifices seems to be the
                            ambition of a powerful section of Ministers. Lord Milner spoke of the
                            extraordinary venom which is displayed against any South African who
                            takes the British side in the conflict between British and Dutch ideals,
                            between what was Milnerism and what Krugerism. The Little Englanders
                            condemn him as one who must be "animated by the meanest sentiments, a
                            tool of capitalists, &amp; soulless, subservient creature, who can have
                            no higher motive than the greed of gold." These are of the same kidney
                            as the pessimists against whom the German Emperor was moved to lift up
                            his voice in strong irritation a week or two ago, when he lamented that
                            they would not relieve the unfortunate Fatherland of their presence. But
                            the German anti-nationalistf are tyros compared with the British. Ourg
                            are quite unapproachable for their mischievous persistence. How they
                            filled the air with falsehoods about Chinese slavery is notorious - that
                            was perhaps, their greatest achieve. ment, for it was a masterpiece of
                            mendacious hypocrisy. Then &amp; pro-Zulu agitation was started, which
                            would have swollen to ten times its dimensions had a Unionist Government
                            been in power, and the anti-nationalist Press grew eloquent over
                            hypothetical outrages. The outcry against the punishment of the Egyptian
                            villagers who set upon and murdered some British officers has hardly yet
                            died away. Lord Cromer's measured warning to the Home Government of the
                            growth of a fanatic anti-British agita. tion in Egypt is either derided,
                            by these "anti-nationalists" or it is accepted as natural and worthy of
                            all sympathy. The wrongs of India, again, are wringing their bosoms.
                            Englishmen are accused of bleeding India tə death and of intensifying
                            the poverty of her poorest classes. The Bengali agitators find ready
                            champions here at home. Their seditious songs are carefully explained
                            away as harmless ebullitions by a small but pertinacious group of
                            Anglo-Indians, whose patronage of the Congress movement, and tolerance
                            of the Swadeshi agitation, bid fair to cause really serious trouble in
                            Bengal, where the success of their noisy clamour has alarmed the great
                            Mohammedan section of the population. We do not believe that this
                            anti-nationalism, as Lord Milner calls it, is popular with the mass of
                            Englishmen, but it is unquestionably popular with the Radical pulpiteer,
                            and with the Trade Union leaders, who are, for the most parti strongly
                            anti-Imperialist. They carry their followers with them much further than
                            the latter wish to go, and they do so the more light-heartedly, because
                            of their exceedingly limited acquaintance with the affairs of any part
                            of the Empire but their own. There will, as Lord Milner said, be a
                            "tremendous rally" when these pernicious doctrines are pushed too far;
                            but before the rally comes, mischief may be done which can only be
                            eradicated very slowly and at enormous cost.</hi>

                    <p>EXCAVATION OF SAINT MENAS.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="bold">The recent wonderful discovery of the long lost uity of
                            Saint Menas in the wilds of the Mariont desert bas aroused great
                            interest throughout enlightened Barope, for although it was known that
                            this ancient city did exist, and that its site was only a few miles from
                            Alexandria, all attempts to discover it whereabouts had been fruitless.
                            Before the Christian Era the city had been a central point for the trade
                            and caravan routes from Alexandria to Cyrene and the Oasis of Ammon and
                            from central Egypt to the North West, but it is chiefly known to fame
                            for the extraordinary sapotity, which it subsequently obtained owing to
                            the exoja tion of Mena, an officer in the army, son of a Governor of a
                            province of Afrios, who suffered martyrdom under Diocletian. His body
                            was buried there and a Chorob was built to mark the spot. At the end of
                            the fourth century a magnificent basilion was adopted in the reign of
                            Arcadius and became a great resting place for pilgrims and travellers on
                            their way from Alexandria to Nitria. A description is extant by an Arab
                            geographer, who describes the Church of St. Mona as still standing,
                            apparently, to an opinjared condition. | The date at which this
                            description should be placed is probably between the early part of the
                            eleventh and the early part of the fourteenth century, i.e. subsequent
                            to the great destruction of churches in Egypt by the Caliph Hakim, when
                            thirty thousand charges are said to have been ruined in Syria and Egypt.
                            Since that date the old city bas atterley disappeared from history and
                            Sir Massie Blom field in the Bulletin of the Alexandria Arobæological
                            Society for 1904 stated that it is believed that the site was known to
                            the Bedouins, and he adde?:</hi>

                            at Diemer's Library (79.6d.). It is well printed and illustrated with 54

                            The policy of our paper, from its inception has been one of complete
                            independence. We are under no bond or obligation to anyone, nor has any
                            Power or Party the right to dictate to us the political views which they
                            seek to propagate. Whilst laying no claim to infallibility, our purpose
                            is to uphold the cause of justice, liberty and equality, to expose
                            abuses and to lead our countrymen along the path of progress and
                            enlightenment. In this sense, and in this sense alone, we are
                            Nationaliste. We are likewise, and for similar reasons,
                            PanIslamists.</hi>

                        <hi rend="bold">Sir, – You will have the British Colony with you if you
                            demand a full, searching and independent inquiry into the causes of the
                            non arrival of the "Isis” on Wednesday morning. There are rumours
                            afloat, pamely, that the ship was known to be in an unseaworthy
                            condition by reason of a partial disablement of her machinery before she
                            left port, and it is now alleged that she has put into Zante with a
                            broken shaft. Of course the company will be prepared with an exculpatory
                            explanation, for that is the way with companies as with governments
                            whenever they are called to account. But that will not eatis'y the
                            publio. What they went, and you should insist upon their having, is an
                            independent official investigation. To put a company upon its defence
                            and to rest satisfied with whatever excuse it may choose to offer is
                            like calling upon the accused to sit in judgment upon him. self. In the

                            of experts, should be made known, so that the blame, if blame there be,
                            should rest upon the proper shoulders and dve precautions taken, should
